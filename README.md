### Google Notepad

This is a small hack I worked on at HackUMass. My first Google Chrome extension, Google Notepad allows you to type "notepad" into Google and be presented with a small text area in which to take quick notes. On the phone and need to jot something down? Chances are you're already at a browser. Very similar to Google's native Calculator app, this serves as a lightweight convenience. Upon clicking enter, the note is emailed directly to you if you're logged in to Google Chrome.
